        <h2>About Wheel Be There</h2>
        <p>Wheel Be There is a centralized digital hub built for Trinidad’s growing car community. From supercars and vintage rides to modified beasts, we know the scene is alive — but it’s been stuck in second gear. <br><br>

            <span class="bold">The Problem</span><br>
            Car lovers are constantly missing meets, shows, and competitions because there’s no one place to find them all. Event organizers struggle with low turnout, lost sponsorships, and poor visibility. And with no easy way to connect, the whole community takes the hit. <br><br>
            
            <span class="bold">The Solution</span><br>
            Wheel Be There fixes that. Our platform brings together enthusiasts, organizers, and sponsors in one place.<br>
            🎟️ Event Listings – Verified and detailed: dates, locations, entry info.<br>
            🔔 Real-Time Notifications – Never miss a meet again.<br>
            🔍 Smart Filters – Find exactly what you’re into.<br>
            🤝 Community-Driven – Built by and for car lovers.<br><br>

            This is more than a schedule. It’s the engine behind Trinidad’s automotive future.
